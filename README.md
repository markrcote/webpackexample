This is a very simple web app that calculates a discounted price for a
product.  It is meant to serve as an example of how webpack works.

You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
installed.

Install webpack and its dependencies:
  `npm install`

Create the JavaScript bundle by running webpack:
  `npx webpack`

Serve the site locally:
  `cd dist; npx serve`

The app will then be available at
[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
